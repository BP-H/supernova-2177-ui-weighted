This document outlines how the weighted voting interface connects with other modules in the system.

## Goals
- Enable smooth adoption of the weighted voting engine.
- Provide guidance for developers integrating the UI with backend services.

## Steps
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure the core services and the Streamlit UI are installed.
   - Confirm that `voting_engine.py` is available for species-based weighting.
2. **API Wiring**
   - Use `external_services.fake_api_weighted` as a reference implementation.
   - Connect your backend to expose compatible `vote`, `tally`, and `decide` endpoints.
3. **UI Hooks**
   - The page `pages/proposals_weighted.py` demonstrates how to render weighted tallies.
   - Replace the fake API calls with real network requests as needed.
4. **Testing**
   - Run `make test` to ensure new integrations do not break existing functionality.
