# Transcendental Resonance Frontend

A minimalist social metaverse UI built with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) for interacting with the Transcendental Resonance protocol. This repository contains the modular front-end split from a single monolithic file.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
nicegui src/main.py
```

### Demo mode

To explore the UI without a running backend, load the bundled sample data and
mock API calls:

```bash
python -m transcendental_resonance_frontend.demo
```

This command starts the app using data from `src/utils/sample_data/`.

Replace the backend URL with the `BACKEND_URL` environment variable if your API is not running on `http://localhost:8888`.

## Structure

- `pages/` – individual UI pages (login, profile, VibeNodes, etc.)
- `src/utils/` – shared utilities for API calls and styling
- `src/main.py` – entry point registering pages and launching the app
- `tests/` – pytest-based unit tests (package marked by `__init__.py`)

## Notes

This UI is mobile-first with a futuristic aesthetic. A theme selector cycles between
dark, light, and a new **modern** palette powered by the Inter font.
Future improvements include real-time notifications and internationalization.
