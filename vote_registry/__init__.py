"""Vote Registry Planning Module

This module will provide a registry of validator votes across the
superNova_2177 ecosystem. It currently contains development notes and
placeholder structures only.

Planned features
----------------

* **OAuth or wallet-based identity linking** to tie validators to verified
  accounts or blockchain wallets.
* **Public frontend for vote timelines** allowing anyone to inspect how
  validators have voted over time.
* **Real-time consensus graphs across forks** for visualizing agreement
  metrics and divergence between branches of discussion.
* **tri_species_vote_registry.json** preparation which will capture voter
  entries for ``human``, ``ai`` and ``company`` types.

# Future considerations ------------------------------------------------------
#
# - OAuth or wallet integrations will require secure token handling and possibly
#   a new ``identity`` table in the database linking validator IDs to provider
#   accounts or on-chain addresses.
# - The frontend for vote timelines may live inside the
#   ``transcendental_resonance_frontend`` package or a new web application. It
#   should expose an API endpoint for querying vote history and display an
#   interactive timeline.
# - Consensus graphs across forks will subscribe to registry updates in real
#   time, likely via websockets or server-sent events, and plot diverging
#   consensus levels between branches.
# - ``tri_species_vote_registry.json`` should store metadata about each vote
#   including voter type (``human``, ``ai``, ``company``) and context so that
#   threshold calculations can reference species distributions.
# - TODO: log voter class to GraphML metadata for analysis tools
# - TODO: finalize ``tri_species_vote_registry.json`` format for persistent
#   storage of species-aware vote records
# - TODO: implement OAuth/wallet identity linking
# - TODO: expose vote timeline API for the frontend
# - TODO: store species data in tri_species_vote_registry.json

# Design outline -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The registry will ultimately link validator entries to OAuth identities or
# blockchain wallet addresses, enabling transparent verification of vote
# ownership. A lightweight public frontend will visualize each validator's
# voting timeline by consuming this module's API. To track evolving consensus
# dynamics, real-time graph components will subscribe to vote updates across
# forks. The underlying ``tri_species_vote_registry.json`` structure will map
# every vote to one of three voter categories—``human``, ``ai``, or
# ``company``—so that cross-species participation and thresholds can be
# analyzed programmatically.

# TODO: Implement OAuth or wallet-based identity linking for validators.
