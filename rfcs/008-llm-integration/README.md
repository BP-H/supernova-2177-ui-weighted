# LLM Integration

## Problem Statement
The current validation workflow depends on manually crafted hypotheses and step-by-step user input. This limits the speed and variety of checks that can be performed because every scenario must be typed out or pre‑written.

## Proposed Solution
Introduce a `llm_analyzer.py` module that interfaces with open‑source language models. The script would accept historical logs and hypothesis templates, send them to a local or Hugging Face model, and return suggested hypotheses or validations. Results could then be fed back into existing pipelines for automated exploration.

## Alternatives
* Use a hosted API service to generate suggestions, which reduces local requirements but creates network dependencies.
* Ship lightweight local models only, which avoids external calls but may reduce output quality.

## Impact
Adding an optional LLM layer increases modularity by separating natural‑language reasoning from core analytics. There will be a performance cost when models are loaded, but this can be mitigated with caching and asynchronous execution.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create `llm_analyzer.py` with functions to load a model and produce hypothesis suggestions.
2. Add configuration options for choosing between Hugging Face endpoints or local weights.
3. Extend validation scripts to optionally call the LLM module for augmented checks.
4. Document usage and provide examples in the demos directory.
