# Initial Proposals

## Summary
A collection of thirty ideas to inspire future improvements in governance, coexistence and sustainability.

## Motivation
These suggestions kick off discussion around enhancing fairness, collaboration and long‑term stability for the superNova_2177 project.

## Specification
### Governance tweaks
- Auto‑propose annual audits via quantum simulations.
- Reward ethical remixes with fork badges.
- Hold yearly votes to add new species starting with "hybrid".
- Cap the Gini index at 0.3 and redistribute excess votes.
- Provide AI‑only sub‑universes for testing.
- Integrate consent APIs aligned with UNESCO ethics.
- Drop dynamic thresholds 5% after three years if entropy is low.
- Evolve patron saint AIs from compliant data feeds.
- Use prediction managers to block single‑species dominance.
- Allocate treasury shares to safety research.

### Coexistence boosters
- Require co‑elevation pacts in remixes.
- Enable multi‑species debate voice mode.
- Offer bonuses for proposals citing risk frameworks.
- Guarantee a minimum AI veto share in company votes.
- Cross‑remix bridges need mutual consent.
- Encourage emergent personas blending networking and AI ethics.
- Boost harmony for diverse voter pools.
- Waive daily decay for well‑regarded actors.
- Log human‑AI interactions to refine bias detection.
- Explore global cooperation through forks.

### Sustainability mechanics
- Implement karma staking for passive yields.
- Use marketplace fees to maintain AI operations.
- Extend genesis bonuses for ethical forks.
- Split influencer rewards with a safety escrow.
- Reward accuracy with funding for open‑source upgrades.
- Establish wellspring savings pools.
- Add engagement catalysts for multi‑species events.
- Pay symbolic royalties to original actors.
- Enter eco‑mode when engagement is low.
- Form co‑elevation guilds sharing harmony rewards.

## Rationale
These ideas demonstrate potential evolution paths while staying aligned with the project's collaborative ethos.

## Drawbacks
- Significant implementation effort may be required.
- Some suggestions could conflict with existing rules or policy.

## Adoption Strategy
Submit each item through the standard RFC and voting process. They serve as seeds for more detailed proposals.

## Unresolved Questions
- Which proposals should be prioritized first?
- How can complex mechanisms, such as quantum audits, be prototyped?
